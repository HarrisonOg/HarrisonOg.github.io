I’m an Android software engineer based in the SF Bay Area, currently working as a Senior Software Engineer at Mozilla on Firefox for Android, where I focus on modern Android architecture, Jetpack Compose, and user-facing features that scale globally.

By trade, I build reliable, well-architected mobile software. By curiosity, I’m always learning something new — whether that’s experimenting with computer vision and autonomous drones, prototyping electronics with Arduino and Raspberry Pi, or exploring game development with Unity. I enjoy projects that sit at the intersection of software, hardware, and creative problem-solving.

Outside of programming, I spend my time painting tabletop miniatures, backpacking in California’s backcountry, baking, and woodworking. This site is a collection of things I’m building, learning, and tinkering with — both professionally and just for fun.
