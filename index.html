    <h1>Harrison Oglesby</h1>
    <p>I am a programmer in the California Bay Area with about two years of professional development experience of front-end web development and Android development at Klinche. In 2016, I built the prototype Android application for the Klinche platform using Retrofit for requests and Realm for data storage.  I also worked on our web application using Angular 2.0 and Redux architecture. Recently I spent about the last 8 months working on performing light web penetration testing, getting Klinche ready for security audits and contacting vendors for security tools and third party penetration tests as well as developing for the front-end Angular/Redux structure. </p>
    
    <p>I also work for a software company called DABSquared.  There I work on their DABDisplays, small media displays that are used for things like menu displays in restaurants to satellite status displays for Space Systems Loral.</p>
    <p>In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, camping, swimming and eating food.  I also love video games, playing CSGO and PUBG among others on the PC.  I am currently working on a VR game for the Daydream platform using the Unity engine.  When it is closer to release status, I'll post more videos here.</p>
