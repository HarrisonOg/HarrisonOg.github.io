    <h1>Welcome to my personal page</h1>

    <p>My name is Harrison Oglesby and I am a 25 year old programmer living in the South Bay (planning on moving to SF or Oakland soon).</p>
    <p>I've got about a year and a half of professional development experience mixed between front-end web development and Android development at Klinche. In 2016, I built the prototype Android application for the Klinche platform using Retrofit for requests and Realm for data storage.  I also worked on our web application using Angular 2.0 and Redux architecture. Recently I spent about the last 8 months working on performing light web penetration testing, getting Klinche ready for security audits and contacting vendors for security tools and third party penetration tests as well as developing for the front-end Redux structure. </p>
    <p>I also worked for a small software company called DABSquared.  There I worked on their DABDisplays, small media displays that could be used for things like menu displays in restaurants to satellite status displays for Space Systems Loral.</p>
    <p>In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, camping, swimming and eating food.  I also love video games, playing CSGO and PUBG among others on the PC.  I am currently working on a VR game for the Daydream platform using the Unity engine.  When it is closer to release status, I'll post more videos here.</p>
