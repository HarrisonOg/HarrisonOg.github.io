Spiderman Homecoming came out last night.  In my humble opinion, it is the best Spiderman movie.  Tom Holland is a great Peter Parker and perfectly plays a high school kid.

In other news, I'm still working on javascript to cover major data structures.  I'm also starting the "What's my commute" Android application.  I will keep updating as time goes on.
